**OVERVIEW**

Every year, tens of thousands of players from around the globe gather to compete in Pokémon VGC tournaments, all dreaming of earning that elusive World Champion title. Success at this level demands meticulous preparation: you need a team that’s fully equipped to navigate the shifting metagame and emerging trends. Unfortunately, official Pokémon resources offer little in the way of actionable statistics, and manually scouring endless Poképastes is both time-consuming and impractical.

This projects bridges that gap by providing comprehensive, up-to-date analytics on tournament metagames. By aggregating and analyzing data from major events, PokémonStats delivers clear insights into usage patterns, popular strategies, and rising threats — empowering you to make informed decisions, fine-tune your squad, and potentially uncover the next meta-defining breakthrough.
